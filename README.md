# AICTE-INTERNSHIP- Personal-Fitness-Tracker
🥗 AI-Powered Calorie Prediction WebApp
This project is a machine learning-based WebApp developed using Streamlit to predict calories burned during physical activity. The model takes user inputs such as Age, Gender, BMI, Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature and provides an accurate calorie prediction using Random Forest Regressor.
🎯 Features
✅ Predicts calories burned based on user inputs.
✅ User-friendly and intuitive Streamlit interface.
✅ Real-time visualizations and insights.
✅ Displays similar results based on predicted calories.
✅ Provides general comparisons with other data points.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend/Modeling: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression
Data Handling: Scikit-learn, Pandas
📄 How It Works
Input Parameters:

Age

Body Temperature
Model Training:

Training data is preprocessed and used to train Random Forest and Linear Regression models.
Prediction:

User inputs are passed through the trained model to predict calories burned.
Result Display:

The app displays the predicted calorie value and provides comparative insight.
